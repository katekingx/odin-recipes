    <h4>I just don't dig on swine, that's all</h4>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1¼ cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off
        <li>¾ cup yellow cornmeal
        <li>¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder
        <li>1 teaspoon salt
        </li>2 large eggs
        <li>2 tablespoons honey
        <li>¾ cup milk (preferably whole but low-fat works too)
        <li>1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F degrees. Line a muffin 
            pan with paper liners or spray with non-stick cooking 
            spray. (I prefer to use non-stick cooking spray 
            so the muffins get nice and crisp on the edges.)</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, break up the eggs with a whisk. 
            Whisk in the honey, and then the milk. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, 
            and salt. Add the milk mixture and the melted butter to 
            the dry ingredients. Whisk until just blended. 
            Do not overmix; it's okay if there are a few lumps. 
            Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin pan, 
            filling each cup about ¾ full. Bake for 17 to 20 minutes, 
            or until the tops are set and golden. 
            (Note that the muffins will not dome.) 
            Cool the muffins for a few minutes in the pan, then serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
